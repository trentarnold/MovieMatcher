# Movie Matcher
Have you ever wanted to watch a movie with a friend, but felt trapped by the number of choices, genres, actors, 
streaming providers? Or you couldn't agree on what title to choose because you wanted a Western and your buddy 
wanted a Thriller? Movie Matcher was created by the four of us to fill that gap. Search, save, and match with ease.
Happy hunting.
